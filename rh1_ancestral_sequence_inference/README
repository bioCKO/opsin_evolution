Notes:
Files in this directory allow reproducing the Bayesian reconstruction of ancestral sequences as well as dN/dS calculations. BEAST runs included in this analysis are relatively fast and can be performed on a desktop computer.

Software required:
bash (tested with GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin16))
java (tested with version 1.8.0_151)
ruby (tested with version ruby 2.0.0p648 (2015-12-16 revision 53162) [universal.x86_64-darwin16])
codeml (tested with version 4.8) (Yang 2007)
R and rscript (tested with version 3.3.2)

Software in bin directory:
beast.jar - Jar archive of BEAST version 2.4.5 Prerelease (Bouckaert et al. 2014), obtained from https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/releases.
BEASTLabs - Directory for BEAST add-on package BEASTLabs, imported with BEAUti.
MM - Directory for BEAST add-on package MM (implementing models of Lewis 2001), imported with BEAUti.

Input files in data directory:
alignments/indels.nex - Specification of indel absence and presence in Nexus format.
alignments/rod_opsin_trimmed.phy - RH1 gene alignment, trimmed by removing positions after site 1052.
tables/key_tuning_sites.txt - Table of key spectral tuning sites.
trees/rod_opsin_notranslate.tre - MCC tree of the time-calibrated RH1 gene phylogeny (see the directory for analysis 'rh1_gene_tree_inference').
xml/indels.xml - BEAST input file for the Bayesian reconstruction of indel states at internal nodes of the gene phylogeny. This file was produced with BEAUti.
xml/nucleotides.xml - BEAST input file for the Bayesian reconstruction of nucleotide states at internal nodes of the gene phylogeny. This file was produced with BEAUti.

Executing this pipeline:
cd [PATH]/phylogenetic_inference/src
bash run_all.sh
