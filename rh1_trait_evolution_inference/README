Notes:
Files in this directory allow reproducing the reconstruction of lambda_max evolution based on the RH1 gene tree.

Software required:
bash (tested with GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin16))
R and rscript (tested with version 3.3.2)
geiger (R package; tested with version 2.0.6) (Pennell et al. 2014)
phytools (R package; tested with version 0.5-64) (Revell 2012)
ape (R package; tested with version 4.0) (Paradis et al. 2004)
Rphylopars (R package; tested with version 0.2.9) (Goolsby 2017)
picante (R package; tested with version 1.6-2) (Kembel 2010)

Input files in data directory:
tables/keep_list.txt - List of gene ids for Diretmus argenteus.
tables/wavelengths.txt - List of lambda_max values for Diretmus argenteus RH1 genes, based on experiments and prediction.
tables/wavelengths_model_predicted.txt - List of lambda_max values for Diretmus argenteus RH1 genes, based on atomistic modeling.
trees/rod_opsin.tre - MCC tree resulting from RH1 gene-tree analyses (see directory 'rh1_gene_tree_inference').
trees/rod_opsin.trees.gz - gzip-compressed file with the posterior tree distribution of RH1 gene trees (see directory 'rh1_gene_tree_inference').

Executing this pipeline:
cd [PATH]/rh1_trait_evolution_inference/src
bash run_all.sh
