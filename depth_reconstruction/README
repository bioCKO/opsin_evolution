Notes:
Files in this directory allow reproducing the reconstruction of depths at internal nodes of the teleost species tree.

Software required:
bash (tested with GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin16))
R and rscript (tested with version 3.3.2)

Input files in data directory:
101g_nucl_conc_28bfossils.combined.tre - time-calibrated teleost species tree (result file of the analysis 'phylogenetic_inference', see the respective directory)
depth_mindepth1.txt - Table with median catch depths of teleost species. A minimum depth of 1 meter is used.

Executing this pipeline:
cd [PATH]/depth_reconstruction/src
bash run_all.sh
